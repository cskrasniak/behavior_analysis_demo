    "In order to encourage access and use the IBL data used for and released with the [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.909838v2) paper detailing the standardized training of the IBL, the Outreach Working Group of the IBL created this tutorial. The purpose of this document is to encourage the use of IBL data, specifically as a resource for teaching the use of python for the analysis of neuroscience and psychology data. Many simple data analysis questions can be explored with this data set, a few examples of which are in the accompanying document DOCUMENT. We hope these questions will help future neuroscientists and psychologists explore this dataset and perhaps make their own unique discoveries as they learn to use python for data analysis."
